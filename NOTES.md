## Latent Space Search Overview

The latent space search in the demo AI app project involves a process where user queries are transformed into a search in a latent space, which represents the data in a way that captures semantic relationships between items. 
This is particularly useful for searching complex data like movies based on natural language queries. Here's how it works based on the provided code:

**Vector Search**: The app/search/page.tsx file shows that the search page uses a VectorClient to perform searches. When a user submits a query, this client likely interacts with a vector search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch with a vector plugin, Vespa, or Pinecone) 
that has indexed movie data in a high-dimensional vector space. The vector.retrieve method is called with the user's query and some parameters (like the type of data to search for and the number of results to retrieve). This method translates the query into a 
vector and retrieves the closest vectors from the index, which correspond to movies.

**Ranking Results**: After retrieving the initial set of results based on vector similarity, the results are passed to the rankMovies function defined in lib/rank.ts. This function filters and ranks the movies based on their scores. It appears to aggregate scores 
for movies (possibly from different aspects of the search or multiple queries) and then sorts them to prioritize higher-scoring movies. The threshold of 0.79 is used to filter out results with scores below this value, indicating a focus on relevance.

**Displaying Results**: The ranked list of movie IDs is then used to fetch detailed movie data (likely from a database or an in-memory store) using a batchGet function. The final step involves rendering these movies on the search results page, displaying details 
like the title and poster.
